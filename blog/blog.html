      <h1 class="jumbotron mt-1">Transfer news: Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid</h1>
      <hr />
      <h3>What has Zidane said about a return for Ronaldo?</h3>
      <p id="articleText">Zidane smiled and waxed lyrical when asked about Ronaldo, and who can blame him?

        “You know what Ronaldo is for Real Madrid, what he’s done and a player that is dear to us all,” Zidane said.
        “The most important thing is that he is a Juventus player and we have to respect this.”

        The Portuguese forward will go down as one of the greatest players in Real Madrid history, if not the best ever,
        and his legendary status is intact. A return wouldn’t impact that, but it would be fun.

        The key thing here: if Ronaldo returns, does that mean captain and fellow legend Sergio Ramos will sign a new
        contract? Do Real have the funds to bring the superstar back? Or keep all of their star players?

        It seems like Juve are keen to move Ronaldo on, and Real are one of the few teams who could afford his wages.

        Ronaldo left Real Madrid just before Zidane was fired and now he’s back in charge, perhaps we will get a few
        more years of a return to the true Galactico era?</p>

      <p>
        After winning back-to-back Serie A titles, Ronaldo has failed to help Juve win the Champions League during his
        three-season stay in Turin as they’ve been dumped out of the competition without getting past the quarterfinal
        stage.

        He has one more year left on his huge contract at Juve but there is a lot of talk that Andrea Pirlo wants to
        build a new-look team around younger players and the Italian giants would be keen to move on Ronaldo’s huge
        wages.

        Overall, he’s scored 92 goals in 121 appearances for Juve in all competitions, which is still incredible, but
        not leading them to the Champions League title will be seen as a failure.
