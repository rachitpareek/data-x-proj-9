This is our project's repo!

We will be doing a few things:
- scraping, cleaning, and storing data
- loading it into a notebook to train a model for political leaning/credibility
- hosting this model with a web server/api
- creating a google chrome extension to help users access the service & its output. see tutorial here: https://www.sitepoint.com/create-chrome-extension-10-minutes-flat/
